## What is QMGsurvey?

QMGsurvey (released at [GitHub](https://github.com/laura-olivia-felder/QMGsurvey)) is a Mathematica based program that can be used to analyse quantum matrix geometries, based on the algorithms from [arXiv:2301.10206](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10206). See also [arXiv:2009.03400](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03400) by Harold Steinacker for the general construction.
See [the wiki](https://github.com/laura-olivia-felder/QMGsurvey/wiki) for more information and documentation.

## How to use QMGsurvey?

### The Files

The file QMGsurvey.wl represents the main package of this software. It collects the methods that allow the investigation of a given matrix configuration.
The file QMGxX.wl can be used to construct points in target space and matrix configurations (the SU(3) matrices are constructed based on [arXiv:0908.3864](https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.3864) by Richard Shurtleff).

The folder "examples" contains many examples, demonstrating and explaining the usage of QMGsurvey.wl and QMGxX.wl.

The folder "documentation" keeps a copy of the wiki-based documentation.

In order to use QMGsurvey.wl and QMGxX.wl, these have to be imported into a Mathematica notebook or similar.
