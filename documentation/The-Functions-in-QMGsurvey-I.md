## MatrixRankWORKAROUND
_For internal use; provides a workaround for MatrixRank that gives zero if the matrix almost vanishes._

**Arguments**

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M | Real(m,n) | a real matrix of arbitrary dimensions |
| tolerance | Real | the numerical tolerance in the calculation of the rank |

**Output**

The output is out.

| Output | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| out | Int | the rank of M |

**Description**

MatrixRankWORKAROUND calculates the matrix rank of matrix M with a numerical tolerance.
In comparison to MatrixRank, it always returns 0 if the magnitudes of all components are smaller than the tolerance.

**Example(s)**

An example where the tolerance is important:
```mathematica
M={{1.,2.},{1.,2.0001}};
tolreance=0.01;
MatrixRankWORKAROUND[M,tolerance]
```

An example where MatrixRankWORKAROUND and MatrixRank are different:

```mathematica
M={{1.,2.},{1.,2.0001}};
tolreance=0.01;

**Description**

RealNullSpace calculates the real kernel of the complex matrix M (represented by a basis) with a numerical tolerance.
This is calculated by calculating NullSpaceWORKAROUND of Join[Re[M],Im[M]] (what works although Join[Re[M],Im[M]] is not a square matrix).

| tolerance | Real | the numerical tolerance in the calculation |

**Output**

The output is out.

| Output | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| out | Bool | True if v is a linear subspace of w, else False |

**Description**

CheckSubspace checks if the vectorspace V represented by v is a linear subspace of the vector space W represented by w up to the given tolerance.
Note that V is a subspace of W if and only if the dimension of the span of all basis vectors of W is the same as the dimension of the span of all basis vectors of V and W together.
Therefore, it suffices to check if the matrix rank of w is the same as the matrix rank of Join[v,w] as the dimension of the span of basis vectors is the same as the matrix rank of the matrix built from the basis vectors.
This is implemented in CheckSubspace.
Compare to [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10206) section 3.1.

An basic example:
```mathematica
v={{1.,0.}};
w={{1.,0.},{0.,1.}};
tolreance=0.01;
CheckSubspace[v,w,tolerance]
```

An example where the tolerance is important:

v={{1.,0.0001}};
w={{1.,0.}};
tolreance=0.01;
CheckSubspace[v,w,tolerance]
```

tolreance=0.01;
CheckSubspace[v,w,tolerance]
```

**Description**

qmgProbe calculates all outputs of qmgBasic and calculates the (real) kernels and (real) ranks of the tangent map of q (that is Txq), g, omega and theta
and further compares their kernels.
These comparisons have a nice interpretation: If for example kernelsComparison(1) is True that means that g is zero on all vectors outside the range of Txq (what is clearly expected); if for example kernelsComparison(2) is true that means that omega is zero at least on all vectors that are in the kernel of g.
A few non trivial relations are expekted: k_i+ranks(i)=Dim, ranks(1)=ranks(2)≥ranks(3), kernelsComparison(1)=kernelsComparison(2)=True.

The output consists of the Euclidean legth - length with respect to the Euclidean metric and the quantum length - the length with respect to the quantum metric.
These two can deviate strongly.

| projectionData={} | if projectionmode=="default": {};<br> if projection mode=="project": {Real(3,Dim),Real(Dim,Dim)};<br> if projection mode=="slice": {Real(3,Dim),Real(Dim,Dim),Real(Dim),Real} | the data that is needed for construction of the plot <br> in the "default" case, nothing is needed;<br> in the "project" case this is a list consisting of a truncated orthogonal matrix Orth and projector P of rank three such that the composition of Orth and P also has rank three;<br> in the "slice" case the latter list is suplemented by a vector v specifying the slice and a slice tolerance epsilon |

**Output**

| Output | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| plot | Mathematica Plot | a plot of the processed input points |
| pointset | {Real(k_1,3),...,Real(k_n,3)} | a list of length n consisting of the processed input points |
| Colors | {Color,...,Color} | a list of length n consisting of the input colors |

**Description**

qmgPlotTS plots points in target space for a given matrix configuration.
For that purpose, three modes are available.<br>
The mode "default" is the same as "project" with
```mathematica
(Orth=ConstantArray[0,{3,Dim}];Orth[[1,1]]=1;Orth[[2,2]]=1;Orth[[3,3]]=1);
P=DiagonalMatrix[Join[{1,1,1},ConstantArray[0,Dim-3]]];
```
The mode "project" uses the composition of Orth and P to map the input points into the three dimensional Euclidean space. These are then plotted according to the chosen colors.<br>
The mode "slice" at first selects points $x$ such that $\vert(\mathbb{1}-P)\cdot x-v\vert<\epsilon$ (for epsilon=0 this condition defines a three dimensional plane through v in target space). These are then processed as in the mode "project".

## qmgPlotQM
_Plots points in the quantum manifold, represented by points in target space._


**Arguments**

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| X | MatConf(Dim,Nim) | a matrix configuration |
| xsets | {{Real(k_1,Dim),Color},...,{Real(k_n,Dim),Color}} | a list of length n consisting of lists. Each of these consists of a list of k_n points in target space (the first index specifies a point) and a color that is used for visualization |
| Asymptotic=False | Bool | whether or not to use the asymptotic Hamiltonian |
| projectionmode="default" | Str | the mode used to construct the plots. Either "default", "project" or "slice". For more information see the description |
| projectionData={} | if projectionmode=="default": {};<br> if projection mode=="project": {Real(3,2\*Nim),Real(2\*Nim,2\*Nim)};<br> if projection mode=="slice": {Real(3,2\*Nim),Real(2\*Nim,2\*Nim),Real(2\*Nim),Real} | the data that is needed for construction of the plot. Compared with qmgPlotTS, we work with $\mathbb{C}^{Nim}\cong\mathbb{R}^{2Nim}$ instead of $\mathbb{R}^{Dim}$ <br> in the "default" case, nothing is needed;<br> in the "project" case this is a list consisting of a truncated orthogonal matrix Orth and projector P of rank three such that the composition of Orth and P also has rank three;<br> in the "slice" case the latter list is suplemented by a vector v specifying the slice and a slice tolerance epsilon |

**Output**

The output is {plot,pointset,Colors}.

| Output | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| plot | Mathematica Plot | a plot of the processed input points |
| pointset | {Real(k_1,3),...,Real(k_n,3)} | a list of length n consisting of the processed input points |
| Colors | {Color,...,Color} | a list of length n consisting of the input colors |

**Description**

qmgPlotQM plots quasi-coherent states coming from points in target space for a given matrix configuration (thus this should be thought of plots of the quantum manifold).
For that purpose, three modes are available.<br>
The mode "default" is the same as "project" with
```mathematica
(Orth=ConstantArray[0,{3,2*Nim}];Orth[[1,1]]=1;Orth[[2,2]]=1;Orth[[3,Nim+1]]=1);
P=DiagonalMatrix[Join[{1,1},ConstantArray[0,Nim-2],{1},ConstantArray[0,Nim-1]]];
```
The mode "project" at first calculates qmgLightweightAsymptotic[X,x,Asymptotic] for each point.
The resulting quasi-coherent state is then split into real and imaginary part (then denoted by z) and with the composition of Orth and P mapped into the three dimensional Euclidean space. The outcome is then plotted according to the chosen colors.<br>
The mode "slice" at first selects quasi-coherent states $z$ such that $\vert(\mathbb{1}-P)\cdot z-v\vert<\epsilon$ (for epsilon=0 this condition defines a three dimensional plane through v in $\mathbb{R}^{2Nim}$). These are then processed as in the mode "project".

**Description**

qmgPlotEQS plots embedded points for a given matrix configuration.
For that purpose, three modes are available.<br>
The mode "default" is the same as "project" with
```mathematica
(Orth=ConstantArray[0,{3,Dim}];Orth[[1,1]]=1;Orth[[2,2]]=1;Orth[[3,3]]=1);
P=DiagonalMatrix[Join[{1,1,1},ConstantArray[0,Dim-3]]];
```
The mode "project" at first calculates qmgEmbedding[X,x,Asymptotic] for each point.
The resulting xBold (denoted by $\mathbf{x}$) is mapped into the three dimensional Euclidean space with the composition of Orth and P. The outcome is then plotted according to the chosen colors.<br>
The mode "slice" at first selects embedded points $\mathbf{x}$ such that $\vert(\mathbb{1}-P)\cdot \mathbf{x}-v\vert<\epsilon$ (for epsilon=0 this condition defines a three dimensional plane through v in $\mathbb{R}^{Dim}$). These are then processed as in the mode "project".
